# Problem Solving Approach

### 1. Understanding the problem
    -> restate the problem in own words
    -> what are the input and output
    -> is there enough information to solve the problem
    -> thinking of labelling data (don't use random label like i, j, k)
    -> checking the example with invalid, empty input, (edge cases)

### 2. Note down the details like input, output and outcome

### 3. Start with naive/brute force approach. First thing that comes into mind. It shows that you're able to think well and critically (you don't need to write this code, speak about it)

### 4. Tell them why this approach is not best (i.e O(n^2) or higher, not readable etc..)

### 5. Walk through your approach, comment things and see where you may be able to break things.

### 6. Before you start coding, walk through your code and write down the steps you are going to follow.

### 7. Breakdown the steps and comment is the ultimate key, rundown of thinking process, steps. Breaking down code will give you extra advantage

### 8. Start coding (simplify as necessary)

### 9. Can you write it better in terms of readability, time, space complexity

### 10. If your interviewer is happy with the solution, the interview usually ends here. If it also common that the interviewer asks you extension questions
